### Project Title
Bike Share Data Analysis Project


### Description

This project is part of the Udacity Programming for Data Science with Python Nanodegree program. The project involves exploring data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, D.C. The goal of the project is to use Python to analyze the data and uncover important insights about bike-sharing trends, such as popular times for riding, user types, and trip durations. The program allows users to filter data by city, month, and day of the week and provides a summary of the key statistics based on the selected criteria.
### Files used

bikeshare.py: The main Python script that contains the code for loading, processing, and analyzing the bike share data.
chicago.csv: The dataset containing bike share data for Chicago.
new_york_city.csv: The dataset containing bike share data for New York City.
washington.csv: The dataset containing bike share data for Washington, D.C.
### Credits

The project and datasets were provided by Udacity as part of their Programming for Data Science with python Nanodegree program.
The datasets are based on actual bike share data from Motivate, which operates bike share systems in various cities.
Thanks to various online resources and blogs that provided insights and guidance for handling CSV files and performing data analysis using Python.
