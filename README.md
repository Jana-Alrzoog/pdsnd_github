<h1 align="center">🚲 Bike Share Data Analysis Project</h1>


## 📘 Project Description

This project is part of the **Udacity Nanodegree: Programming for Data Science with Python**.

The goal of the project is to explore and analyze data from bike share systems across three major U.S. cities:
- **Chicago**
- **New York City**
- **Washington, D.C.**

Using **Python**, we developed an interactive program that:
- Loads the data
- Filters based on user input (city, month, day)
- Displays insightful statistics about:
  - Peak travel times
  - Trip durations
  - User types and demographics

The analysis helps uncover trends and behaviors related to urban bike-sharing systems.
